## Stock Prediction

In this module, we use the yfinance library to extract historical stock data for Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. We analyze closing prices, explore the correlation between daily returns and closing prices, and employ machine learning algorithms, including LSTM, for stock price prediction.

## Stock Recommendation

Utilizing a dataset from 2010 to 2011, this module employs standard scaling, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and K-means clustering to provide stock recommendations based on customer behavior patterns.

## Predictive Analysis of Medical Insurance Cost

Using a dataset with categorical and personal features, linear regression is employed to estimate medical insurance costs based on input features such as age, gender, and region.

## Insurance Plan Recommendation

This module utilizes heart-related data to predict the presence of heart disease for individuals. Logistic Regression is used to train the predictive model, and basic and premium insurance plans are recommended based on user input.

## Investment Returns Calculator

A feature that calculates investment returns for a given year. Integrated with Chart.js for visually appealing growth charts and JavaScript calculations for accurate financial projections.
